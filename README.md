# Distributed Deep Learning on Spark Clusters

This repo includes the scripts used in this [blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2018/08/02/distributed-deep-learning-on-aztk-and-hdinsight-spark-clusters/) 
which demonstrates distributed deep learning on AZTK Spark cluster and Azure HDInsight Spark cluster by walking through two examples - one 
for image classification and the other for time series forecasting.
